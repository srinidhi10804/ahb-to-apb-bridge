# ahb-to-apb-bridge
The AHB to APB bridge facilitates communication between high-speed AHB masters and low-speed APB peripherals by translating protocols, ensuring efficient and synchronized data transfer in SoC designs.
I have attached the simulation results , rtl viewer and the report for getting aware of the design done.
